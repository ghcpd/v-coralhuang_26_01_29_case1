You are given a repository that contains a known parsing bug and needs to be fixed and validated with automated tests.

Constraint: work only with the source code in the provided folder/repository. Do not rely on the pre-installed or externally installed `sqlglot` package (no "use the upstream library as-is"). Any fixes and tests must run against the repository's local implementation.

In Snowflake SQL, `//` is a valid single-line comment, for example:

SELECT 1 // hi this is a comment

This query runs correctly in Snowflake.

However, when parsing it with the repository's sqlglot code using the Snowflake dialect, an error is raised:

parse_one("SELECT 1 // hi this is a comment", read=dialects.Snowflake)

The parser treats `//` as a division operator instead of a comment delimiter, which causes the parse to fail (this corresponds to issue #1763).

In addition, SQL strings may contain template-style comments such as `{# ... #}`. These comments should be treated consistently as comments during tokenization and should not be partially parsed as normal symbols or operators, even when dialect-specific comment rules are overridden.

The expected outcome is:

* The Snowflake dialect must correctly support all common comment styles:

  * `--` single-line comments
  * `/* ... */` block comments
  * `//` single-line comments
* Parsing `SELECT 1 // comment` with the Snowflake dialect must succeed and produce the same semantic result as parsing `SELECT 1`.
* Template comments like `{# ... #}` must be recognized as complete comments during tokenization and handled consistently across dialects.
* Comments must not affect AST construction or be misinterpreted as operators.

You must add or update automated tests to ensure the bug is fixed and does not regress.

The test coverage should include:

* Parsing Snowflake queries with `--`, `/* */`, and `//` comments.
* Verifying that queries with and without comments produce equivalent ASTs.
* Ensuring `//` is not parsed as a division operator.
* Verifying that `{# ... #}` comments are tokenized as a single, complete comment and not split into partial tokens, using at least one non-Snowflake dialect for regression coverage.

You must also add or update a README that explains:

* Why `//` comments are valid in Snowflake but previously failed to parse.
* The intended behavior for comment handling in Snowflake and for template comments.
* How to run the tests.
* What scenarios the tests cover and how they prevent regressions.

At the start, you will be given three files in a broken or incomplete state:

* issue_test.py: tests for parsing the three Snowflake comment styles (`--`, `/* */`, `//`)
* minimal_repro.py: a minimal reproduction of issue #1763 (Snowflake `//` comments not supported)
* snowflake.py: the Snowflake dialect implementation in the repository, where the fix is expected to be applied

Your task is to modify the code, add tests, and documentation so that the expected behavior is achieved, under the constraint above.

Additionally, provide a one-command test runner script (file extension is not important) that runs the full test suite. The README must explain how to use this script (including any prerequisites and the exact command to run).
